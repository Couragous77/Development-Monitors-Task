# Development-Monitors-Task
Source code for html and JavaScript files, screen shots, demo, and readme file with steps taken to complete the task as well challenges faced 

Hey,

So I had a couple classes and club reesponsibilities to forfill so I didnt have much time to work on the task. How ever I was able to successfully load the GLTF file into the application. 

STEPS: 
First I uploaded the GLTF file into Blender to get an idea of what i was looking for
Next, i took the steps to install the necessary instals through the terminal and following the tuitorial in the link you provided
I then created the project set up and tested it by running ther server and created a model of a spinning cube provided by the tutotrial
After ensuring everything was running smoothly, it was time to start with the actually completing the task. 
I uploaded the model you provided, but could not see it.
I then tested the file by uploadingt it to threejs.orh/editor to see if it would actually show. 
The image did indeed show so I assumed there must either be a lighting issue or the object was too large or extreamly too small. 
I then played  around with two lights and found one that worked. i could see something new but it wasnt what i saw on blender when i uploaded the gtfl file so i started playing with the size and scale of the model 
After scaling down, i was finally able to see the model 
The model was still not in the conditions that i wanted but due to a lack of remaining time, i chose to submit so i was unable to play around with the model further.
